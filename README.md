## Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to provide actionable insights through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The project includes a comprehensive dashboard that summarizes key metrics and trends related to road accidents, such as accident frequency, severity, causes, and geographical distribution.

## Features:
- Data Cleaning: Raw accident data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
- Data Analysis: Performed in-depth analysis using Excel functions, pivot tables, and formulas to uncover trends and patterns.
- Interactive Dashboard: Created a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard using Excel charts, slicers, and conditional formatting.

## Key Insights:
- Identified the most common causes of accidents (e.g., road type, vehicle type, weather conditions).
- Highlighted high-risk areas and times for accidents.
- Analyzed the impact of vehicle types on accident severity.

## Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization).
- Pivot Tables and Charts
- Slicers for Interactive Filtering
- Conditional Formatting for Highlighting Key Data
